# FermWise IoT Device Integration

This directory contains scripts and examples for integrating IoT devices with the FermWise platform. These scripts demonstrate how to implement the "Take Reading" functionality for your IoT devices.

## API Endpoint

The FermWise API provides an endpoint for IoT devices to send sensor readings:

```
POST /api/device/readings
```

### Request Format

```json
{
  "serial_number": "FW-DEVICE-12345",
  "temperature": 25.4,
  "humidity": 65.2,
  "soil_temperature": 22.1,
  "soil_moisture": 42.8,
  "livestock_temperature": 38.5
}
```

All sensor readings are optional, but at least one should be provided. The `serial_number` field is required.

### Response Format

```json
{
  "message": "Sensor readings recorded successfully",
  "serial_number": "FW-DEVICE-12345",
  "farm_id": "farm_001",
  "timestamp": {
    "seconds": 1672531200,
    "nanoseconds": 0
  },
  "readings": [
    {
      "id": "reading_id_1",
      "serial_number": "FW-DEVICE-12345",
      "farm_id": "farm_001",
      "type": "temperature",
      "value": 25.4,
      "unit": "Â°C",
      "timestamp": {
        "seconds": 1672531200,
        "nanoseconds": 0
      }
    },
    // Additional readings for other sensor types
  ]
}
```

## Test Scripts

### JavaScript Test Script

The `test-device-readings.js` script demonstrates how to send sensor readings using JavaScript/Node.js:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install node-fetch
   ```

2. Update the configuration in the script with your device serial number:
   ```javascript
   const config = {
       apiUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',     // Update with your API URL
       serial_number: 'FW-DEVICE-12345'     // Update with your device serial number
   };
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   node test-device-readings.js
   ```

### Python Client

The `iot_device_client.py` script provides a more complete example that could run on an actual IoT device:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Update the configuration in the script with your device serial number:
   ```python
   CONFIG = {
       "api_url": "http://localhost:8080",      # Update with your API URL
       "serial_number": "FW-DEVICE-12345"       # Update with your device serial number
   }
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python iot_device_client.py
   ```

   This will display a menu where you can select "Take Reading" to send sensor data to the API.

## Integrating with Real Sensors

To integrate with real sensors, modify the reading functions in the Python script:

```python
def read_temperature():
    """Read temperature from sensor"""
    # Replace with actual sensor code
    # Example with DHT22 sensor:
    # import Adafruit_DHT
    # humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read_retry(Adafruit_DHT.DHT22, 4)
    # return temperature
    
    return round(random.uniform(15, 35), 1)  # Dummy value
```

Replace the dummy implementations with code that reads from your actual sensors.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify that the FermWise API server is running
2. Check that your device serial number is correctly configured
3. Ensure your network connection allows access to the API endpoint
4. Check the API server logs for error messages
